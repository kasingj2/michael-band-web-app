Bleeped out the speaker when She got to your name
Freaked out the teacher when you lost at The Game
Everyone and everything was pointing the other way
Wrote on your T-shirt Nothing's the Same
Wrote on your shoes The World is Insane
Wrote on your notebook Life is Pain
And now you're living and there's nothing to say
At least, not that way

Break skin like every day
I cut deep, but that's OK
It's just words that make the play
It's just hips that make you sway
Just lips that make you pay
Just grip that makes your way
One slip you'll fall away
One trip, one blip, they'll turn today

Anxiety
Don't cry for me
Don't hide the beast
Don't pry the least
Don't climb the peaks
Don't find my leaks
Don't guide my freaks
Just leave me with the dirty sheets and fucked up pieces of the leash

Yet you hold on to the feeling that you have been after
Follow what you know that you have everlasted
Making your star
Chaos and Dancing

Put your makeup away
Put away all those fanciful things
I wanna see you naked
I wanna see you all the way down
To the bones
Feel you the way that you feel

Yeah you hold on to the feeling that you have been after
Follow what you know that you have everlasted
Making your star
Chaos and Dancing
